                                   Salutations! My name is John Randolph and I am an aspiring web developer.
                                    I have come here with little experience or knowledge in this industry. I am learning everything from scratch. 
                                     This is undoubtedly the most intellectually strenuous exercise I have ever voluntarily participated in. 
                                     Even with a Bachelors Degree from Rutgers, I have found myself stuck in careers in the service industry. 
                                     I realized if I ever wanted to recareer I needed to learn new skills and push myself out of my comfort zone. 
                                    Coding is the lifeblood of modern technological society.  What I learn here can be transmitted to diverse fields of industry the world over.
                                     I am grateful for the opportunity to change the direction of my professional life!
